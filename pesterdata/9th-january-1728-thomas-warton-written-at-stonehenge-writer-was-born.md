![Thomas Warton](/images/Thomaswarton.jpg)On this day in 1728 poet laureate Thomas Warton was born in Basingstoke. He wrote 'Written at Stonehenge'. I wrote about 'Written at Stonehenge' here: 

* <a href="/stonehenge-2/written-at-stonehenge-by-thomas-warton">'Written at Stonehenge' by Thomas Warton</a>.

The poem goes as follows:

> Thou noblest monument of Albion’s isle!

> Whether by Merlin’s aid, from Scythia’s shore,

> To Amber’s fatal plain Pendragon bore,

> Huge frame of giant-hands, the mighty pile

> T’ entomb his Britons slain by Hengist’s guile:

> Or Druid priests, sprinkled with human gore,

> Taught ‘mid thy massy maze their mystic lore:

> Or Danish chiefs, enrich’d with savage spoil,

> To Victory’s idol vast, an unhewn shrine,

> Rear’d the rude heap: or, in thy hallow’d round,

> Repose the kings of Brutus’ genuine line;

> Or here those kings in solemn state were crown’d:

> Studious to trace thy wondrous origine,

> We muse on many an ancient tale renown’d. </blockquote>
